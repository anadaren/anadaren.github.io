            <b>Summary:</b>
            <p>Throughout the Spring 2023 semester of my Master's program, I was tasked with created a short game every week for six weeks for a Game Prototyping class. This page describes the different tiny games I created during that time. Each project was made in Unity, and was based around a specific prompt.
